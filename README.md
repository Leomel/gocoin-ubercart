## Using the Official GoCoin Ubercart Plugin
When a shopper chooses the GoCoin payment method and places their order, they will be redirected to gateway.GoCoin.com to pay.  
GoCoin will send a notification to your server which this plugin handles.  Then the customer will be redirected to an order summary page.  

The order status in the admin panel will be "Processing" when the order is placed and payment has been confirmed.
